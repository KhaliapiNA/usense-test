Hello all. I would like to thank USENSE for the opportunity to do such a task. 
This was the first time when I make somthing on Angular. 
During task solution I came across options for solving this problem, but the usual addition of a specially available tag didn't like me, so the code you see turned out like this.

Task:
Create applications to test password strength.

The essence of the assignment:
Create a field for entering a password, under the field add 3 sections which will show the strength of the password;
Changes in password strength must take place in real time;
How to calculate the strength of a password:
Only letters/digits/symbols - the password is easy;
Combination of letters-symbols/letters-digits/digits-symbols - the password is medium;
Has letters, symbols and numbers - the password is strong;
The color of the sections will depend on the strength of the password:
If the field is empty, all sections are gray;
If the field has less than 8 characters, all sections are red;
If the password is easy - the first section is red the rest are gray;
If the password is medium - the first two sections are yellow the last one is gray;
If the password is strong, all sections are green;
